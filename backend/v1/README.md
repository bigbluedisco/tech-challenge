<h1>Software Engineer Challenge (Backend)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
In the logistics, inaccurate address is the primary reason why orders do not arrive on time
(<a href="https://magento.com/sites/default/files8/fixing-failed-deliveries-community-insight.pdf">Magento, 2018</a>).
<br/>
At Bigblue, we are constantly receiving e-commerce orders from our merchants' stores, therefore we have to make sure that the addresses provided are valid to ensure a frictionless delivery.<br/>
Your challenge here is to design and implement address validation for orders shipped to France.
<br/>
<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>We value a clean, simple working solution. Some code is already provided, so that you just have to write over it.</li>
<li>The project must be submitted as a git repository (github, bitbucket, gitlab). Repository must avoid containing the words <code>bigblue</code> and <code>challenge</code>.
<li>Having unit tests is a strong bonus</li>
</ul>
<h2>The project</h2>
The current codebase sets up a simple gRPC API written in Golang & gRPC/Protobuff. It's composed of:
<ul>
<li>a product service that exposes a fixed list of products</li>
<li>an order service to be implemented to manage orders</li>
<li>a <code>generate.sh</code> script to be executed in order to generate client/server code for stubs, based on the proto files.
<li>a store used to mock a persistant storage for orders and products. Read/write operations should only be done through the transactor interfaces.<br />
‚ö†Ô∏è&nbsp The store code must not be edited.
</li>
<li>a <code>server.go</code> to initialize services and launch the API.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Missions</h2>
You have to improve the gRPC API in order to allow order management, as well as the address validation system that checks the destination of orders before creating or updating them.
<br />
<h4>I- Order service</h4>
The current system exposes a product service that provides a fixed list of products through an RPC.<br />
The goal here is to improve the order service in order to create orders based on the products:
<ol>
<li>Complete the proto of the product service to implement a RPC that retrieves a single product by its ID.</li>
<li>Complete the proto of the order service and implement a RPC that creates a new order.<br />
Orders should have the following info::
<ul>
<li>customer's firstname</li>
<li>customer's lastname</li>
<li>the ordered quantities</li>
<li>the shipping address
<ul>
<li>address line (45 Rue des Petites Ecuries)</li>
<li>postal code (75010)</li>
<li>city (Paris)</li>
<li>country (FR)</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h4>II- Address validation</h4>
As discussed previously, you should propose and implement a solution to validate the shipping address of an order before creating it:
<ul>
<li>If the address contains some slight errors and the correct data can be identified with certainty by the system, the address will be automatically fixed and the order is created. Some examples:<br />
<ul>
 <li>45 Rue des Pet<b>is</b> Ecuries ‚Üí 45 Rue des Pet<b>ites</b> Ecuries</li>
 <li>1 Square Emile Z<b>i</b>la" ‚Üí 1 Square Emile Z<b>o</b>la</li>
 <li>Par<b>i</b> ‚Üí Par<b>is</b>
 <li>Aubervi<b>l</b>iers ‚Üí Aubervi<b>ll</b>iers<br />...
 </ul>
</li>
<li>
Otherwise, if some parts of the address cannot be recognised and the system fails to validate it, the order is not created and a response with an error code is returned.
</li>
</ul>
The system will be restricted to the validation of French addresses.<br />
For this task, the French Government Address API could be helpful: <a href="https://geo.api.gouv.fr/adresse">https://geo.api.gouv.fr/adresse</a>
